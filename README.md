# How to configure the Gradient Precision with **batch size**?  
What is Batch size??
Batch size is the number of examples from training dataset used to estimate the error gradient in learning algorithm.
**Batch size control the accuracy of error gradient while training the Neural Network.**
There are three main flavors of learning algorithms to control the accuracy of error gradient.
**1. Batch Gradient Descent 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent 3. Mini batch gradient descent**
